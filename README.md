# Test
This test is the first time I am using this.
turtle.dig() turtle.forward() turtleedu.say(" Hey Guys ")
That code was from Lua
I wasn't very good at Lua
Thats why I'm here now
I'm even pretty sure that that line of code has mistakes in it
Save changes is pretty cool
It's pretty much an update change
But without overwriting the old code
